<h4>Price List</h4>

<p>Here you can request a commission for our artists to do.</p>

<p>Here's how it works: Give us a description of what you would like, and the type of piece it should be. You will then be provided with a preview of what the final piece should look like. </p>

<p>If you like the preview, you can then commit to a purchase, and your work will be completed and posted to you.</p>

{% for type in comm_types %}

        <p>{{ type.type_name }} <span>â‚¬{{ type.price }}</span> </p>
        

{% endfor %}

<p>Remember you don't pay for your Commission until after you have requested it and seen your preview</p>
